**Personal finance management in Emacs using Org-mode**

---

## Overview

org-finance *will be* an Emacs package for managing personal finances using Org-mode as the data store. It will provide budgeting, transaction tracking, and financial reporting with an optional backend for automatic bank synchronization.

I know there are already Emacs finance packages, but I want that automatic bank sync (Plaid?) and better budgeting.
